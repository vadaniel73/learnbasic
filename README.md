# Basic of github
Here basic commands and important functions are listed
Git is a perfect version control software that is used to backup the information and retain the version 
The main terms are pull and push which referfs to the interaction between the server and the remote system
Pull downloads all the files from the remote server and the chages are stored both in locally and in server 

To clone the repository from remote to local you have to clone by using giitbash installed in the system and  get the link from the git hub site and type "git clone https://... "

To get status of the update type "git status"

After creating a file you have to add it to the staging area which is done by "git add <filename>"

After adding we have to commit the file "git commit -m "This is jus a text will show while commiting""""

THis has to folowed by pushing the files to remote repository "git push"
